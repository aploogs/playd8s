Installed dotenv, request, unirest and steam-api in package.json
I forgot to export the routes/steam page module
I didn't set the routes for app.use('/steam, steam') in the backend. We have to set that up since we are hitting the backend and getting the api data from there. 
To differrentiate between which is bacnend and frontend, if something console.logs in the terminal, then that is something belonging to backend. 
Don't forget to: require('dotenv').config(); in the backend app.js file
